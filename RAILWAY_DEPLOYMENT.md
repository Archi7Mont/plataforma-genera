1. Open your Railway app URL
2. Navigate to `/login`
3. Login with:
   - **Email**: `admin@genera.com`
   - **Password**: `admin123`
4. You should see the admin dashboard! ‚úÖ

## Share with Your Team

Once live, share this link with your team:

```
https://your-railway-app-url.com
```

They can:
- Test the login system
- Create new users
- Generate passwords
- See the elegant password cards
- Approve/reject users

## Database Persistence

Unlike Vercel's serverless, **Railway keeps your file system persistent**! 

This means:
- ‚úÖ User data survives app restarts
- ‚úÖ Passwords stay saved
- ‚úÖ No need for environment variable backups
- ‚úÖ Everything works like local development

---

## Stop/Pause Deployment

When you're done testing:

1. Go to Railway dashboard
2. Click your project
3. Click **"Settings"**
4. Click **"Delete Project"** (optional)
5. Or just leave it - the free tier covers it
